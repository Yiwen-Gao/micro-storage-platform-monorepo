# Micro-Storage Platform

### Motivation
This project enables anyone with a personal computer to offer a percentage of their machine's storage capacity and participate in Filecoin's storage deals. Together, these individuals--or micro-storage providers (mSPs)--offer collective storage power and uptime that are comparable to those of dedicated storage providers with specialized hardware. 

Decentralization + democratization. 

### Setup
Since `lotus` is a submodule, run
```zsh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
to initialize and fetch the code.
